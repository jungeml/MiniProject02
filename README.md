=============

i2c is taken from Dr. Yoder's i2c file. However I made several changes to the matrixLEDi2c.c file. First I created my own design that lasts for 5 seconds and is at the end of the design sequence. Second I turn off the matrix LED 8x8 device. And third, I omitted the for loop at the end of the sequence.
